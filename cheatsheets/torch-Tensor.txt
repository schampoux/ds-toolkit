stride: 
    a tuple indicating the number of elements in the storage that have to be skipped when the index is increased by 1 in each dimension. 
Contiguous 
    a tensor whose values are laid out in the storage - 
        starting from the rightmost dimension onward


# ----------------
# Storage
# ----------------

The storage holds the elements in the tensor sequentially, row by row. 


Values in tensors are allocsted in contiguous chunks of memory managed by `torch.Storage` instances.
    One dimensional array of numerical data. 
    A contiguous block of memory containing numbers of a gviven type. 

A pytorch tensor instance is a view of such a storage instance that is capable of indexing into that storage using an offset and per-dimension strides.

# In-place operations 
# --------------------

Indicated by a trailing underscore in the name. 
tensor.zero_()                                            # returns a tensor of zero's

# Dtypes
# ----------------

torch.float32 or torch.float: 32-bit floating-point

torch.float64 or torch.double: 64-bit, double-precision floating-point

torch.float16 or torch.half: 16-bit, half-precision floating-point

torch.int8: signed 8-bit integers

torch.uint8: unsigned 8-bit integers

torch.int16 or torch.short: signed 16-bit integers

torch.int32 or torch.int: signed 32-bit integers

torch.int64 or torch.long: signed 64-bit integers

torch.bool: Boolean

When mixing input types in operations, the inputs are converted to the larger type automatically. 

torch.zeros(10, 2).double()                  Cast the output of a tensor creation function to the right type using the corresponding casting method. 
torch.zeros(10, 2).short()
torch.zeros(10, 2).to(torch.double)          Checks whether the conversion is necessary and if so, does it. 
torch.ones(10, 2).to(dtype=torch.short)

Transposing: 
    Changing the order of the elements in the stride. 
    No new memory is allocated 

torch.transpose(tensor, dim1, dim2)          Transpose the tensor given the dimensions (dim1, dim2) to swap
t.transpose(dim1, dim2)            
t.t()                                        Shorthand function to transpose for 2D tensors 
t.clone()                                    Clone into a new tensor.
