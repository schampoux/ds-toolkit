df.corr()

Compute a pairwise correlation of columns in a DF using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient by default. 

Pearson Correlation: 
    r = cov(X,Y)/(sd_x)(sd_y)

This method: 
    1. Standardizes each column by subtracting the mean and dividing by its standard deviation. 
    2. Computes the covariance between each pair of columns. 
    3. Divides the covariance by the product of the standard deviations. 

The result is a square matrix (DF) where each cell (i,j) represents the correlation coefficient between column i and column, j
    - 1.0: Perfect positive correlation (as one increases, so does the other). 
    - 0.0: No linear correlation 
    - (-1.0): Perfect negative correlation (as one increases, the other decreases).
