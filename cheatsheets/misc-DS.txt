Outliers: 
    This term does not have a precise standard definition. Many people define it using the innerquartile range (IQR)
    IQR - The difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles. 
        - The value at the 75% point (.quantile(.75)) minus the value at the 25% point
    Outliers are then values below the 25% point - 1.5*IQR or values above the 75% + 1.5*IQR
