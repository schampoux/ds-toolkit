cifar10 = training data 
cifar10_val = validation data 
to_tensor() = transforms.ToTensor()
tensor_cifar10 = training data instantiated with transform.ToTensor()

Our input to the model is a tensor of size (1, 3017) 
    1 corresponds to the batch
    3017 corresponds to all the other dimensions (3x32x32)

Our models first layer is linear 
    (3072, 512) # 512 arbitrarily chosen

The second (hidden) layer is the activation function 
    Tanh()

The third layer is linear, 
    (512, 2) # 2 is the size of our output, (probabiliry of airplane, probability of bird) 

Then we hit the softmax
    Each element of the output must be in the 0 to 1 range 
    The elements of the output must add up to 1
